# Stawka - Cute Stalker Utility

This is a small helper program I threw together to help me find people on /r/ProgrammingLanguages. It's not creepy, I swear. I just want to feel a tinge of humanity.
H-hey! Wait! W-where are you going? It's not weird, please!
**Creep by Radiohead starts playing**

### Function
First the latest Reddit submissions are fetch and put into a table in the database. They are then filtered for Github repo links, which are fetched and into put into the database. Based on a few criteria, repos are selected for manual review by the user and are then classified based on interaction potential.

### Ethics
While the ethics of such a practice are debatable, one has to consider
that I'm just a poor, socially deprived, lonely programmer. **does puppy eyes**
Also, this system only collects public information that people post willingly.
Plus mega corps and government doing so, so much worse things with your data,
so you really shouldn't be concerned about this thing.
I don't upload any of the data I collect and the database is stored on an encrypted drive.
